# Modified Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe 

# Setup
 - Draw a large 3x3 grid.
 - Inside each of the nine squares, draw another 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe board, creating 81 total playable spaces.

 # Gameplay
 - First Move: The first player (X) can play in any of the 81 small squares on any of the nine boards.
 - Determined Next Board: The square you choose in a small board determines which small board your opponent must play in next (e.g., playing in the     top-left square of a small board sends your opponent to the top-left large board).
 - Winning a Small Board: Get three of your marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) in any small board to win that board. Mark the entire square on the big board with your symbol (X or O).
